# walls (deprecated)

### **DEPRECATED. I no longer have time to maintain this project. This may change if and when I acquire enough devices to test for cross-platform compatibility.**

A tiny script to automate the process of setting a desktop background without the hassle of a GUI.

## Quick start

Run the following command...

`git clone https://github.com/citrusui/walls && cd walls && walls/set.sh`

...and that's it!
